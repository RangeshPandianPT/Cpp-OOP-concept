/*üìù Task Description
You are required to write a C++ program using hierarchical inheritance to manage employee information for an organization.

‚úÖ Requirements:
Create a base class BasicInfo that holds the basic employee details:

ename (Employee Name)
eid (Employee ID)
gender (Gender)
Create a derived class DeptInfo (inherits from BasicInfo), which contains department-related details:
deptname (Department Name)
assignedwork (Type of work assigned)
timetocomplete (Expected days to complete the work)
Create another derived class LoanInfo (also inherits from BasicInfo), which contains loan/financial information:
pf (Provident Fund amount)

Use hierarchical inheritance:
Both DeptInfo and LoanInfo inherit from the common base class BasicInfo.

The program should:

Read and display basic info for both department and loan data.

Show department-specific info for DeptInfo.

Show PF info for LoanInfo.*/
